* Data Structures
** Abstract Data Type
An abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a
data structure must adhere to.
** Big-O Notation
Big-O Notation gives us an upper bound of the complexity in the *worst case*,
helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes *arbitrarily large*
*** Expamples
**** Finding all subsets of a set - O(2^n)
**** Finding all permutations of a string - O(n!)
**** Sorting using merge sort - O(nlog(n))
**** Iterating over all the cell in a matrix of size n and m - O(nm)
